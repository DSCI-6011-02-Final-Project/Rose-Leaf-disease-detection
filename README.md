# Rose-Leaf-disease-detection
This project focuses on the comparison of two popular convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, ResNet50 and VGG16, for the detection of rose leaf diseases. The goal is to provide insights into the performance of these models and aid researchers and practitioners in selecting suitable models for similar plant disease detection tasks.

## Dataset 
The dataset used in this study contains images of rose leaves affected by various diseases, including black spot, downy mildew, and fresh leaves. We downloaded the dataset from Kaggle. Dataset link is given below:

## Model Training and Evaluation
Both ResNet50 and VGG16 models were trained using the dataset, and their performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Training time were also analyzed to assess computational efficiency.

## Results
ResNet50 demonstrated a shorter training time compared to VGG16.
VGG16 achieved higher accuracy, indicating better generalization capability.
